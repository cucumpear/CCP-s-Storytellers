  <description>Both Reika and Bellatrix hit hard and fast. Call on them when Randy has turned into a comfy stroll through the park. Bellatrix might be less random than Reika, but don't underestimate her.
  Gary, on the other hand, loves to give. He will throw traders, drops and weather at you aplenty, but beware! On the rare occasions when he does send a raid it will be a big one.
  
 Important note: To make Gary work properly I had to re-categorise some of the "neutral" events to "small threats." All of my storytellers are rebalanced, but vanilla and other modded storytellers are not. The differences are relatively minor, though.
 New feature for the extra hardcore folks: two extra difficulties. Let me know how much fun/rage was had!
 
 I highly recommend combining this mod with Marvin's Sometimes Raids Go Wrong for more hilarity.</description>
